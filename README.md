# PredominantPictureColor
Hi! This project is my first independent project outside of a college class and my first time using GitHub so hopefully everything is working. This program asks
a user for an image and tells the user which color is the most common color within that image. The program reads in the image, identifies the RGB values for each
pixel, converts RGB values into HSV values to better differentiate between colors, and identifies which color is most common. Example images can be found in the test_images folder but you can run the program with any image (that works with the Java BufferedImage class, you can use JPEG, PNG, and GIF for sure) as longs as it's in the test_images folder. To run the program, enter the name of an image in the test_images folder with the file type extension when prompted (ex: blue.png). Please let me know if you see anything that could be improved.
