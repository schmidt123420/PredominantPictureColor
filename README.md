# PredominantPictureColor
Hi! This project is my first independent project outside of a college class and my first time using GitHub so hopefully everything is working. This program asks
a user for an image and tells the user which color is the most common color within the picture. The program reads in the image, identifies the RGB values for each
pixel, converts RGB values into HSV values to better differentiate between colors, and identifies which color is most common. Please let me know if you see anything
that could be improved.
